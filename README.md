# TriviaGame

- - -
### Overview:

*This game makes use of setInterval and setTimer to power a timed trivia game
*The contents of the game being sailor moon is coincidental because I had a drawing I had done of sailor moon

### Pain Points:
*Initially, I had not set my timers and intervals to variables, under the assumption that as there was only one of each, this would not cause problems. This caused problems. I found VERY strange behaviour upon answering the questions, the timer and interval would become very erratic.
